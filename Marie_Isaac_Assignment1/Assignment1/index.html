<h1>Week 2</h1>


<div>
<h2>Question 1</h2>
<h3> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
<p>The first thing that caught my eye was the interactive background.
    When first entering the website i was greeted to a fish net like background which once clicked teared the net 
    creating holes, also i notcied that when hovering your cursor over the background it would create a ripple like effect.
</p>

        <h2>Question 3</h2>
        <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>I spent the most time interecting with the club simulator, can be found in the rop header and is the second icon. This part was really fancisting to me as you can 
            charcter dance by holding down the left mouse button and get the character to jump, also i sent my friend the link and when he clicked on the club simulator i can see his character
            also.

            <h2>Question 4</h2>
            <h3> What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
            <p>The most common action when interacting with this experience was clicking and hovering over the different interactive backgrounds</p>
        </div>

                <h2>Question 5</h2>
                <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
               <P>My impression of the primary goal was to advertise for the music label francual fantasy and in theme of the artists brand indetnity which is furturistic and choatic.
                The interactive experience commumiocates and showcases this there the websites styling in CSS.
               </P>

                    <div>
                    <h2>Question 6</h2>
                    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
                    <p>THe interactive experience communicates this by its intereactive backgrounds, futurics and cyberpunk design and colour board. Each new page and interactive experience
                        has an audio showcasing the artists music. THerefore communicateing its primary goal
                    </p>
                
                </div>

                        <h2>Question 7</h2>
                        <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
                        <p>This interaction could definatly be used for a while as this website has mutilple interactions the user can found sometimes others being weirder or cooler than others
                            This website can be visted mutilple times to either have fun in the club simulator or go to buy some merchandise from the artist.
                        </p>

        <h2>Question 9</h2>
        <h3> What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        
         <p> The media forms that are referenced in this experience i would say is, digital video, 3D design and music. 
            The digital video can be seen when clicking through the different pages in the header, the 3D design with some parts of the interaction. Also the whole theme
            realated to the labels music.

                <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
                <p> The obcuirty of the interactions communicate that you should feel curious and somwhat amazed, theres so much you can do from ,lstening to the music, exploring
                    the 360 videos to even running around in a club simulator.

                    <h2>Question 12</h2>
                    <h3> What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
                    <p> The most frustrating part of the interaction i found was everytime i'd go to the next page the video that would be playing would always be
                        at 100% volume and theres no way to control the volume.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        <h2>Question 13</h2>
                        <h3> What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
                       <P> The most satisfying part of this interaction i;d say would be the interactive backgrounds you can play with, 
                        as said in question 1 the homepage with the net like background is really fun to play with, being able to tear it. Another thing
                        i'd like to add is the club simulator changes everyday, one day it would be red and have a certin song playing then the next day
                        it'd be green woth a differentsong playing i found this really satisfying.
